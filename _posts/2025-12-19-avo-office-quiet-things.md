One gentle spring, a small avocado named Avo rolled into a curious place known as the Supply Grove—a room where lists whispered, papers rustled like leaves, and important things were quietly decided.

Avo was new, and it showed.

She was silent, shy, and unfailingly polite, greeting everyone with a tiny nod and a soft presence. No one quite knew where she came from, only that she had arrived with a notebook, a careful heart, and an air of gentle mystery.

Rather than speaking much, Avo watched.

From her little spot in the corner of the Supply Grove, she observed how the office forest functioned: how requests drifted in, how approvals wandered across desks, and how timelines grew and looped like patient vines. She studied it all quietly, letting understanding come to her instead of chasing it.

Friendships bloomed slowly. Avo was kind to everyone, but she found comfort among fellow sprouts—others who were also new, learning their way through the Builder’s Meadow, where plans were planted and sturdy things slowly took shape. With them, she felt lighter, less alone.

Back in the Supply Grove, Avo often waited.

She sat peacefully in her corner, passing the quiet moments with patience, waiting for a task to find its way to her. When the stillness lingered, she endured it gently, trusting that her time would come.

And when it did, her pit stirred.

Avo worked with care and focus, even if her hands were still learning. She made mistakes—small tangles, misplaced seeds—but she never turned away from them. Instead, she learned, corrected, and tried again, fixing what she could as soon as she noticed.

Little by little, Avo changed.

She grew steadier, more familiar with the rhythm of the Grove. Still quiet, still reserved—but now dependable. When something needed doing, Avo did it thoughtfully, with intention and quiet resolve.

Avo didn’t take over the office with noise or haste.

She simply grew into it.

And in the calm hum of the Supply Grove, everyone learned that even a gentle, overthinking avocado can find her place and flourish 🌿🥑✨
