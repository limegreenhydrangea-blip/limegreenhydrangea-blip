Hi, I’m Avo.

I’m a sweet friend at heart — the kind who cares deeply, even if I don’t always show it right away. I tend to be a little guarded at first, quietly observing, thinking things through from every angle. My mind likes to wander into what-ifs and maybes, and yes… I sometimes overthink. A lot.

- Kind, loyal, and genuinely caring
- Thoughtful and reflective (sometimes too thoughtful)
- Guarded, but warm once you’re close
- A natural overthinker with a soft heart
- Calm in a crisis (after thinking about it thoroughly)
- Reliable — I get the job done, even if I worry along the way
- Quietly supportive and always rooting for my friends

What else do you need?

### My story

I grew up learning that the world can be a little unpredictable, so I learned to protect my soft center. I take my time trusting, my time deciding, and my time understanding — but that’s because I care about doing things right.

While others rush ahead, I pause, plan, and prepare. I might question myself, replay conversations, or imagine every possible outcome — but when it’s time to act, I follow through. I don’t give up easily, especially on people or things that matter to me.

This little corner of the internet belongs to me — a place where I can be thoughtful, honest, and quietly brave. Where overthinking is allowed, kindness is valued, and progress doesn’t have to be loud to be real.

Thanks for being here.
